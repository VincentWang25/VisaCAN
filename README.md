# US Visa Appointment Scheduler

Current example is to book US visa appointment in Canada and Mexico.

Instruction:
1. **Copy** `cfg_template.yaml` into `cfg.yaml` and **change** each content into desired format. Remember to change `debug` from `true` to `false` after you have checked the program outputs the desired information.
2. `python3 run.py`
   1. again, remember changing `debug` in `cfg.yaml` from `true` to `false` after you feel confident about the script output. Otherwise the script wouldn't book the ideal date even when it is bookable.
